      <description>Introduction Hey there! Following my recent presentation at the Elastic Community Event, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to extend the insights into setting up Elastic for cybersecurity tools. In this blog, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a hands-on approach, providing a detailed guide on leveraging Elasticsearch and its toolkit. Our focus? Building a robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool, seamlessly incorporating Suricata, Wazuh, Windows Sysmon, network packet capture, and Apache Webserver. All of this orchestrated within the dependable Proxmox stack and Debian server containers.</description>
