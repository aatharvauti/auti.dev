      <description>First talk on 14th September 2024, at University of Southern California, Los Angeles Presentation: docs.google.com&#xA;I had the privilege of delivering a talk for DSCI 519 at USC. We introduced the concept of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and its role in building high-assurance systems. This session explored the core principles of ZTA, including identity-centric security, micro-segmentation, and continuous monitoring, demonstrating how these concepts fortify system security and minimize risks.&#xA;We detailed a systematic approach to developing ZTA, from system inventory and risk mapping to secure communication and incident response automation.</description>
