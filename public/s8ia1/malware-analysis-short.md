# Malware Analysis IA 1 QB (Short Version)

1. **Define malware with example**
   - Malware, or malicious software, is designed to harm, exploit, or perform unauthorized actions on computer systems.
   - Example: **Trojan Horse**, which pretends to be legitimate software but harms the system upon execution.

2. **How malware impacts cybersecurity**
   - **Data Breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
   - **System Damage**: Corruption of system files and functions.
   - **Resource Hijacking**: Utilizing system resources for malicious activities like crypto-mining.
   - **Reputation Damage**: Loss of trust from customers or clients following a security incident.

3. **Four types of malware**
   - **Spyware**: Secretly monitors and gathers user information.
   - **Adware**: Displays unwanted advertisements and can compromise privacy.
   - **Rootkit**: Enables continued privileged access to a computer while hiding its existence.
   - **Botnet**: Network of infected devices controlled remotely, often used for large-scale attacks like DDoS.

4. **Describe social engineering**
   - Involves deceptive tactics to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information.
   - Techniques include **phishing** (fraudulent emails), **pretexting** (fabricating scenarios to obtain information), and **baiting** (offering something enticing to gain access).

5. **What is malware analysis?**
   - The practice of dissecting malware to understand its origins, functionality, and potential impact.
   - Involves techniques like code inspection, behavior observation, and communication monitoring.

6. **Malware analysis techniques**
   - **Code Analysis**: Understanding the malware's source code for insights into its operation.
   - **Memory Dump Analysis**: Examining the system memory for malicious footprints during or after execution.
   - **Traffic Analysis**: Monitoring network traffic to and from the malware to identify communication patterns.

7. **Explain malware attack vectors**
   - Refers to the methods or pathways malware uses to enter a system, such as through **vulnerabilities in software**, **malicious email attachments**, or **compromised websites**.

8. **Malware propagation techniques**
   - **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Attacking weak points in software to install malware.
   - **File Sharing**: Distributing malware through peer-to-peer networks or file-sharing services.
   - **Social Media**: Spreading malware via malicious links or files shared on social platforms.

9. **Classify Malware based on their behavior**
   - **Encrypting**: Malware that encrypts data for ransom (e.g., ransomware).
   - **Deceiving**: Malware designed to mislead users or systems (e.g., fake antivirus programs).
   - **Replicating**: Malware that self-replicates to spread to other systems (e.g., worms).

10. **Importance of malware analysis**
    - **Threat Identification**: Recognizing new or evolving malware threats.
    - **Security Improvement**: Enhancing system defenses based on malware analysis findings.
    - **Forensic Analysis**: Assisting in the investigation and remediation of security incidents.

11. **Four malware analysis tools**
    - **Ghidra**: NSA's reverse engineering tool for understanding malware code.
    - **Metasploit**: Framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target.
    - **Volatility**: Advanced memory forensics framework for memory dump analysis.
    - **Maltego**: Visual link analysis tool for gathering and connecting information for investigative tasks.

12. **Stages of malware analysis**
    - **Acquisition**: Collecting malware samples for analysis.
    - **Behavior Analysis**: Observing how the malware interacts with its environment.
    - **Reverse Engineering**: Dismantling the malware to understand its components and functionalities.

13. **Static analysis techniques**
    - Involves analyzing the malware without executing it, using tools like disassemblers and decompilers to examine the binary code and understand the malware's potential actions.

14. **Behavioral analysis through static analysis**
    - Predicting how malware might behave based on static characteristics like code patterns, strings, and binary structures without actual execution.

15. **Identifying malware characteristics through file analysis**
    - Involves scrutinizing file attributes, signatures, and anomalies that suggest malicious intent, often using specialized tools to extract and analyze embedded code.

16. **Signature-based malware detection**
    - Relies on predefined patterns or 'signatures' unique to known malware samples to identify and block malware. This method is effective against known threats but may fail to detect new, unknown malware.

17. **Dynamic malware analysis technique**
    - Observing the malware in action within a controlled environment to monitor its real-time behavior, system interactions, and network communications.

18. **Behavioral analysis through dynamic analysis**
    - Focuses on the runtime operation of malware, analyzing its actions, changes made to the system, and communication with external

 servers or other malware.

19. **Malware sandboxing technique**
    - Running malware in a secure, isolated environment ('sandbox') to observe its behavior without risking the host system, helping analysts understand its impact and how it operates.

20. **Sandbox evasion techniques**
    - Tactics used by advanced malware to detect when it is being analyzed in a sandbox environment, such as looking for human interaction or analyzing the hardware and software environment, and altering its behavior to evade detection.
