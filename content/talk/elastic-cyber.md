This talk is all about how one can **leverage Cybersecurity** and create awesome tools and integrations using **ElasticSearch's builtin integrations**. These integrations can be used with pre-existing open source as well as proprietary Cybersecurity tools like **Suricata**, Snort, etc. Not only specialized cybersecurity tools, but also **Apache Web Server** integration that can monitor an Apache2 instance for access and error logs. This talk also demonstrates on adding non-tool integrations like **Network Packet Capture** to monitor the running system.
