I had the honor of delivering a talk at SAKEC, **Mumbai University**, where I introduced the fundamental concepts of **cloud computing**. This session delved into the **core principles** of cloud architecture, service models, and deployment strategies, providing a comprehensive overview of how cloud technology is transforming the IT landscape. Through **practical examples** and **real-world scenarios**, I highlighted the **benefits of cloud adoption** and discussed the key considerations for securing cloud environments. This informative session aimed to equip the audience with the knowledge needed to navigate the evolving world of cloud computing and leverage its potential in their professional pursuits.
