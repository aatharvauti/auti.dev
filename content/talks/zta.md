I had the privilege of delivering a talk for DSCI 519 at USC. We introduced the concept of **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** and its role in building **high-assurance** systems. This session explored the core principles of ZTA, including identity-centric security, micro-segmentation, and continuous monitoring, demonstrating how these concepts fortify system security and minimize risks.

We detailed a systematic approach to developing ZTA, from system inventory and risk mapping to **secure communication** and **incident response automation**. Practical examples and case studies, such as the application of ZTA in Azure AD, **AWS** Nitro Enclaves, and **Google BeyondCorp**, underscored its relevance in modern IT infrastructures. We also addressed challenges like implementation complexity and cloud dependencies, emphasizing solutions like confidential computing and formal verification methods.

Through this session, we aimed to equip attendees with actionable insights to adopt ZTA, enabling secure and resilient high-assurance systems in diverse environments.

### Credits

I extend my heartfelt thanks to [Professor Tatyana Ryutov](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Ryutov/Tatyana) and the DSCI 519 cohort for providing a platform to share these critical insights. Special thanks to my co-presenter, [Kamalesh A.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamalesh-jayapandiaraj-arumugam), for his collaboration and expertise in delivering a comprehensive session on Zero Trust Architecture.
