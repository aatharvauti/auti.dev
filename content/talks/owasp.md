I had the privilege of presenting a talk at SAKEC, **Mumbai University**, diving deep into the intricate workings of web applications while shedding light on the critical vulnerabilities outlined in the OWASP top 10. Through interactive demonstrations, I explained the **underlying mechanics of web applications** and elucidated **strategies to mitigate** these vulnerabilities, empowering the audience with actionable insights to secure their web applications. This engaging session fostered a deeper understanding of cybersecurity principles and the proactive measures required to safeguard digital assets in today's interconnected landscape.
