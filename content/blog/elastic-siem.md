## Introduction

Hey there! Following my recent [presentation](https://auti.dev/talk/elastic-cyber.html) at the Elastic Community Event, I'm thrilled to extend the insights into setting up Elastic for cybersecurity tools. In this blog, we'll take a hands-on approach, providing a detailed guide on leveraging Elasticsearch and its toolkit. Our focus? Building a robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool, seamlessly incorporating Suricata, Wazuh, Windows Sysmon, network packet capture, and Apache Webserver. All of this orchestrated within the dependable Proxmox stack and Debian server containers.

## Unlocking Potential: Harnessing Elasticsearch

Let's kick off with Elasticsearch, our foundation for this cybersecurity endeavor.

#### ElasticStack Use Cases

As an open-source, distributed search, and analytics engine, it offers scalability and real-time search capabilities. Think of it as the engine driving the aggregation, analysis, and visualization of diverse datasets.

[SIEM](https://www.elastic.co/security/siem) stands for Security Information and Event Management  It is a security solution that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats. SIEM tools collect, aggregate, and analyze LARGE volumes of data from an organization's apps, devices, servers, & users in real-time, so security teams can detect & block attacks.

#### Overview of ElasticSIEM


### Installing Elasticsearch and Kibana using Docker

Refer the Official and Latest Elasticsearch Installation [Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) and Kibana [Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/docker.html)

On my personal setup, I created a docker container on a Proxmox LXC which you can download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1M-9qPvdHuzvPfYbTZ8KOtgQ8vltnrFIM)

## Building the Arsenal: Integrating Essential Tools

Our SIEM's strength lies in integration. Suricata, a high-performance Network IDS, stands guard against threats. Wazuh contributes with intrusion and vulnerability detection, adding SIEM capabilities. Windows Sysmon provides advanced system monitoring for Windows environments.

## Decoding Conversations: Network Packet Capture

Understanding digital conversations is key in the cyber realm. Network packet capture becomes our decoder, eavesdropping on these conversations to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate security incidents.

## Securing the Web: Apache Webserver

Enter the Apache Webserver, a critical component in securing web environments. Its role is to scrutinize web traffic, offering protection against potential vulnerabilities and cyber threats.

## Architectural Symphony: Proxmox and Debian Synergy

In orchestrating this cybersecurity symphony, the Proxmox stack and Debian server containers take center stage. Their virtualization capabilities create a flexible and scalable environment, essential for adapting to the evolving cybersecurity landscape.

## Conclusion: Empowering Cyber Defenses

Concluding this guide, we've navigated the intricacies of configuring Elastic SIEM, using Elasticsearch as the backbone and integrating various cybersecurity tools. This comprehensive approach, set within a Proxmox-Debian ecosystem, empowers cyber defenders to stay vigilant in the ever-evolving digital threat landscape. As we decode Elastic SIEM, the journey toward a more secure digital realm unfolds, offering cybersecurity enthusiasts the tools and insights needed for a resilient defense.
